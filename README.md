# Portfolio / Sandbox

I've been reviewing front end material after spending 3 years in the back end cave.

Seems like half of them start with a tutorial involving a personal portfolio site. I figure maybe it's time to actually did one.

#### Disclaimer
For at least a good chunk of it's life it's going to be more like a front end review sandbox and less an actual portfolio.

My intent at this moment in time is to really start from the ground up and redo it as I learn more stuff.

But that's always the intent, isn't it...
